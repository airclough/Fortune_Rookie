Fortune Rookie

Short term, as in hackathon mvp, I set out to have an app where a user could sign up, select a team, and view live streaming stats. I got as far as select a team, but I wouldn't say I miss managed my time. Being a team of one there was a lot to accomplish, so perhaps I was a little too ambitious if anything. I figured having a solid db and api was vital, so I spent a majority of my time setting up just that. Before I knew it, it was 2pm on Sunday and the hackathon was over.

Long term, as in going forward, I would love to create a legitimate NFL rookies fantasy game. I'm obsessed with the NFL draft, so much so that its fair to say I prefer college football over the NFL at this point. I love scouting talent based on stats, analytics, and overall measurables.

In my app I want the user to be able to select his or her team based on where players were actually selected in the NFL draft. A user would get a selection at the top of each of the 7 rounds and fill out their team as they see fit.

If a user wants to select more than one player in a particular round they would have to trade up into that slot using later round picks. I would base trades off of a chart similar to the NFL draft position value chart. Moving back up into the middle of the first round, for example, will probably cost you your second and third round picks.
